**Today's blocks support which spoke?**

**Actions:**
- Block 1-3: Contract/Core work → Financial freedom spoke
- Block 4: Outreach/relationship → Impact + Financial spokes
- 5pm walk: Health spoke (anchor for decades)
- 8pm boys: Family spoke (anchor for decades)
- 10:30pm sleep: Health spoke (foundation for all others)

## Daily Alignment

Every block serves the wheel:
- **Morning blocks (1-3)**: Build financial freedom + impact
- **Afternoon block (4)**: Extend impact, build network
- **Fixed anchors**: Family + Health spokes (non-negotiable)
- **Weekly reflection**: Balance check across all spokes

## Current Focus (12-Week Cycle)

Primary spoke: **Financial freedom** (contract work, outreach)
Supporting spokes: **Health** (anchors) + **Family** (8pm time)
Emerging spoke: **Impact** (build reputation through quality work)

**The wheel turns together. No spoke sacrificed for another.**
