## Sample Conversations

### Week 1 - First Reflection
```
You: I'm ready to start
Agent: Welcome! Let's begin with work. On a scale of 1-10, how satisfied are you?
You: Probably a 6. It's okay but not great.
Agent: Thanks for sharing. What would make it a 7 or 8?
You: Better boundaries and less overtime
Agent: That's a great insight! Let me analyze this...
      [Uses reflection analyzer tool]
      Your work satisfaction baseline is 6/10. Key insight: boundary-setting
      is a priority. Action: Set one specific boundary this week (e.g., no
      emails after 7pm). Resource: Try "Deep Work" by Cal Newport.
```

### Week 5 - Progress Check
```
You: How am I doing on health?
Agent: [Uses progress tracker]
      Great question! Your health score has improved from 4 to 7 over 5 weeks.
      That's a strong upward trend! Your consistent exercise mentions show
      real commitment. Remember your Week 2 entry about feeling tired? You're
      managing energy much better now. Keep it up! üåü
```

### Week 10 - Looking Back
```
You: Can you remind me what I said about finances in the beginning?
Agent: Of course! In Week 1, you rated financial confidence at 4/10 and
      mentioned stress about budgeting. Now you're at 7/10 and tracking
      expenses consistently. Your savings habit has really developed. That's
      75% improvement in just 9 weeks! What changed for you?
