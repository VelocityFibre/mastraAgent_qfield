## Common Use Cases
### Industry Applications
- Archaeological research and documentation
- Conservation projects
- Land surveying and cadastral work
- Government data collection
- Humanitarian and UN initiatives
- Environmental monitoring
- Infrastructure mapping
- Agricultural surveys

### Workflow Scenarios
1. **Field Survey Projects**
   - Create project in QGIS with custom forms
   - Configure constraints and validation rules
   - Publish to QFieldCloud
   - Team members collect data on mobile devices
   - Sync and review data in real-time
   - Analyze results in QGIS

2. **Offline Data Collection**
   - Sync project to device before going offline
   - Collect data without internet connection
   - Sync changes when back online
   - Automatic conflict resolution

3. **Collaborative Mapping**
   - Multiple team members on same project
   - Real-time updates and synchronization
   - Change tracking and version control
   - Centralized data management

## Technical Integration
### QGIS → QFieldCloud → QField Flow
1. **QGIS Setup**
   - Install QFieldSync plugin
   - Configure project for mobile use
   - Design forms and validation
   - Set up symbology and layers

2. **QFieldCloud Configuration**
   - Create project on QFieldCloud
   - Configure permissions and team access
   - Set synchronization parameters
   - Manage storage and backups

3. **QField Mobile**
   - Download project to mobile device
   - Collect and edit data in field
   - Attach photos and media
   - Sync when connectivity available

## Best Practices
1. **Project Design**
   - Keep projects lightweight for mobile use
   - Use appropriate data formats (GeoPackage recommended)
   - Configure validation rules upfront
   - Test on mobile before deployment

2. **Data Management**
   - Regular synchronization schedules
   - Backup strategies
   - Clear naming conventions
   - Version control for projects

3. **Team Coordination**
   - Clear role definitions
   - Communication protocols
   - Training on workflows
   - Regular data quality checks

4. **Performance Optimization**
