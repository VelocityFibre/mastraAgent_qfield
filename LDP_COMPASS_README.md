# LDP Compass Agent (Momentum Sentinel)

## Overview
Your personal productivity coach for Oct 2025. Tracks deep work blocks, fixed anchors, and backcasts from 50-year vision.

## What It Does
- **Block tracking**: Log 4-5 daily 90min deep work blocks with energy levels
- **Vision backcasting**: Reverse-engineer from 80-year-old self to today's actions
- **Anchor management**: Track 5pm exercise, 8pm boys, 10:30pm sleep
- **Weekly reflection**: 12-week cycle with pattern analysis

## Quick Start

### 1. Log a Block
```
Block 1 done: AI prompt, +4 energy
```

Output:
```
Block 1: âœ“ AI work, +4 energy
Strong start. Allocate Block 2: Contract tasks?
Momentum: Carry +4 to next 90min.
```

### 2. Backcast Vision
```
Vision: 50yr me?
```

Agent asks: "At 80: AI mentorship legacy? Impacted how many?"

You answer:
```
At 80, I've mentored 1000+ businesses in AI transformation
```

Output:
```
2075 (80): 1000+ AI businesses mentored
2050 (55): Leading consultancy
2035 (40): 3+ enterprise clients
Oct 2025: First paying client
Action now: Block 4 = 3 outreach emails
```

### 3. Check Anchors
```
Anchor check
```

Output:
```
5pm exercise: Approaching (set 4:55pm alarm)
8pm boys: Scheduled (30min presence)
Sleep: Target 10:30pm bed (8.5hr)
```

### 4. Weekly Reflection
```

## Block System

### Daily Structure (4 mandatory + 1 optional)
1. **Block 1** (7:30-9:00): AI/Core work (highest focus)
2. **Block 2** (9:30-11:00): Contract/Core work
3. **Block 3** (11:30-1:00): Core wrap-up
4. **Block 4** (2:00-3:30): Outreach/Communication
5. **Block 5** (Optional): Personal growth/reflection

### Energy Tracking
- Rate 1-10 after each block
- Agent tracks patterns (e.g., post-walk = +2 energy)
- Low energy (<3) triggers system check (sleep? walk? block quality?)

## Fixed Anchors

### 5pm Exercise
- 20min walk
- Fuels Block 4 energy
- Tracked daily

### 8pm Boys Time
- 30min scheduled
- Relationship anchor
- Full presence

### 10:30pm Sleep
- 8.5hr target (wake 7am)
- Quality rated 1-10

## Vision Framework

### Backcasting Process
1. Define 50yr vision (at 80)
2. Work backward in decades:
   - 2075 (80): Legacy
   - 2050 (55): Leadership
   - 2035 (40): Expertise
   - 2025 (NOW): First steps
3. Agent extracts TODAY's action

### Example

â†“
Today: Send 3 outreach emails (Block 4)
```

## Technical Details

- **Model**: GPT-4o-mini (fast, cost-effective)
- **Tools**: 4 specialized (allocator, backcaster, nudger, reflection)
- **Memory**: LibSQL with working memory
- **Session**: Max 3 exchanges
- **Storage**: All blocks, energy, anchors tracked

## Tips

### Maximize Impact
1. Log blocks immediately after completion
2. Be specific: "AI prompt eng" > "work stuff"
3. Energy honest: Track actual, not ideal
4. Vision clarity: Specific > vague
5. Anchor consistency: Build trust through reps

### Troubleshooting
- **Low energy pattern**: Check sleep quality, exercise consistency
- **Block completion <60%**: Review what's blocking (meetings? distractions?)
- **Vision unclear**: Start with "What problem am I solving at scale?"
