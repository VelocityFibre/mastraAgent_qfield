# Agent Builder Improvements

## âœ… Completed Enhancements

### 1. **Intelligent Tool Suggestions**
The agent builder now analyzes the domain and capabilities to suggest relevant tools:

- **Customer Support**: Ticket management, knowledge base search, sentiment analysis
- **Financial**: Transaction analysis, budget calculations, market data retrieval
- **Data Analysis**: Data processing, statistical analysis, visualization
- **Code/Programming**: Code execution, syntax validation, documentation search
- **Email/Communication**: Email sending, template management, contact lookup
- **General**: Web search, API integration, file processing

### 2. **Memory Integration**
All generated agents now include:
- **Conversation History**: Keeps last 20 messages
- **Working Memory**: Persists session information across conversations
- **LibSQL Storage**: Local database for reliable memory persistence

### 3. **Enhanced Agent Instructions**
The agent builder now:
- Asks about advanced features (workflows, evals, integrations)
- Provides better guidance on next steps
- Suggests tools based on domain
- Explains benefits of Mastra features

### 4. **Improved Code Generation**
Generated agents include:
- Domain-specific tool suggestions with comments
- Pre-configured memory with custom templates
- Modern Mastra patterns (model routing with "provider/model" syntax)
- Comprehensive documentation in comments

## ðŸš§ Recommended Future Enhancements

### 1. **RAG Integration** (High Priority)
- Add semantic search over Mastra documentation
- Provide real-time best practices and examples
- Reference case studies relevant to user's domain

**Implementation**: Use `@mastra/rag` to index docs and answer questions like:
- "What's the best way to handle multi-step processes?"
- "Show me examples of financial agents"

### 2. **Workflow Generation** (Medium Priority)
Generate workflows alongside agents for:
- Multi-step processes with `.then()`, `.branch()`, `.parallel()`
- Human-in-the-loop approvals
- Complex orchestration patterns

### 3. **Evaluation Templates** (Medium Priority)
Auto-generate eval scorers:
- Domain-specific test cases
- Quality metrics
- Performance benchmarks

### 4. **Integration Code** (Low Priority)
Generate ready-to-use:
- React/Next.js components
- API endpoint templates
- Vercel AI SDK UI integration

### 5. **MCP Server Integration** (Low Priority)
- Integrate with external MCPservers
- Suggest relevant MCP tools based on domain
- Auto-configure MCP connections

## Usage

The improved agent builder is now running at **http://localhost:4111/**

Try creating an agent and see:
1. Tool suggestions based on domain
2. Memory pre-configured
3. Better guidance throughout the process
4. Production-ready code output

## Example Output

When creating a customer support agent, you'll now get:
```typescript
// Suggested Tools:
// - Ticket creation and tracking
// - Knowledge base search
// - Sentiment analysis

// tools: {
//   ticketManager: createTicketTool(),
//   knowledgeBaseSearch: createSearchTool(),
// },
```

Plus full memory configuration and domain-specific working memory templates!
